#TODO: Implement the dijkstra algorithm

## Hint: You must be able to reconstruct the path once the algorithm has finished
## Hint: You must be able to visualize the algorithm in action i.e call the methods to draw on the screen to visualize the algorithm in action in the dijkstra function

def dijkstra_algo(draw, grid, start, end):
	"""
	Function that implements the Dijkstra algorithm.

	Args:
	- draw (function): A function to update the grid colors.
	- grid (list): A 2D list representing the grid. Each element is an instance of the 'Spot' class.
	- start (Spot): The starting node to begin pathfinding.
	- end (Spot): The ending node where the path should end.
	
	Returns:
	- path_found (bool): True if a path is found, otherwise False.
	- count (int): Number of Nodes traversed.
	- path_len (int): Length of path.
